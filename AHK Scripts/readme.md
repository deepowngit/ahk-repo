Hey, welcome to a huge repository of AHK scripts.

If the script is written by someone else than me, you will see it in the first few lines of the script, added as a comment.
If you see your own script here and want it removed, dm me Iegendmaxqc#0001 on Discord.


If at some point you see "If InStr(FileContent, "AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF")",
you can just replace it with your own physical address found in command prompt then ipconfig all

Please keep in mind that at any point, these scripts can be outdated, or detected.
Please use with caution.

also I added randombezier.ahk in there incase you need it and don't know where to find it
