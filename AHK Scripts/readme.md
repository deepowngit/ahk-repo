Hey, welcome to this first section of AHK Scripts, these are the first scripts that I have ever written when learning how to code using AHK...

If at some point you see "If InStr(FileContent, "AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF")" y
ou can just replace it with your own physical address found in command promopt then ipconfig all

please keep in mind most these scripts are old and could get you banned if you don't do some changes to them.
I suggest you just use these scripts to learn the basics.

also I added randombezier.ahk in there incase you need it and don't know where to find it
