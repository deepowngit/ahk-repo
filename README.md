welcome to this smol library,

these are most of my ahk scripts that i wrote for people or for fun, 
some of them could be outdating or flat out broken or detected, I suggest you just use these as a learning method.

Also unless stated otherwise, start the script with compass facing north and your camera up arrow all the way up (NOT using the vertical camera plugin of runelite)
also default runelite windowed resolution and 1980x1020.
